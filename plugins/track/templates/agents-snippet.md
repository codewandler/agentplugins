## Start here (every session) — track backlog

This project tracks work with the **track** framework: every unit of work is a markdown story in
`docs/stories/`, and the board (`docs/stories/README.md`) is generated from story frontmatter.

1. **Orient** — read the latest user request, then run `git status --short --branch`. Treat
   uncommitted changes as user-owned unless you made them.
2. **What to work on** — if the user named work, do that. Otherwise open the
   [board](docs/stories/README.md) and take the top `ready` story by `priority` (lower = higher).
   `/track:next` reports it.
3. **The contract** — read the story's `## Goal` and `## Acceptance`; Acceptance defines "done". Read
   any linked `design:`.
4. **Do the work** — set the story `in-progress`; non-trivial design goes in `docs/designs/` first;
   implement; satisfy Acceptance with a **failing-first test**; keep the project's gate green.
5. **On done** — `/track:done <ID>`: set `status: done`, add a CHANGELOG entry, regenerate the board.
6. **New or unscoped work?** Create a story first (`/track:story`) so the next agent inherits the
   context.

The board's status lists are generated — after any change to a story's `status`/`priority`/`title`/
`epic`, run `/track:board`. Story frontmatter is the single source of truth.
